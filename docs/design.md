# Design

A tensor is typed storage plus a strided window onto it. Views share storage; constructors, `copy-tensor`, `astype` and allocating operations return independent storage.

| Slot | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Storage protocol object; built-ins are simple vectors and trivial-simd `vector-view`s |
| `dtype` | Element type keyword, see [dtypes and strides](dtypes-and-strides.md) |
| `shape` | Size of each axis |
| `strides` | Storage step per axis, in elements |
| `offset` | Storage index of the first element |

The element at indices `i0 … in` lives at `offset + Σ ik · stridek`.

```lisp
(let* ((storage (make-array 6 :element-type 'single-float))
       (a (ct:make-tensor-view storage '(2 3)))
       (b (ct:make-tensor-view storage '(3 2) :strides '(1 3))))
  (eq (ct:tensor-storage a) (ct:tensor-storage b)))
;; => T
```

## Tensor type

`tensor` is a structure with read-only slots.[^struct] Shape and strides are `(simple-array fixnum (*))`. `make-tensor` allocates zeroed contiguous storage; `make-tensor-view` wraps existing storage and validates it.

A view is valid when:

- the strides match the rank, the offset is non-negative and every size is non-negative;
- the dtype validates storage compatibility and any layout restrictions;
- every reachable storage index lies inside the storage. An empty view is always valid.

## Extension points

Dtypes are registered CLOS descriptors. Storage kinds implement logical length, type and optional scalar access. Numerical operations select a dtype method before built-in execution; accepted extension out-forms stage independent results and copy through the dtype protocol, or use an explicitly selected alias-safe, failure-atomic direct executor. See [dtype and storage extensions](extensions.md).

Autograd attaches through a wrapper around a tensor, or through a subtype defined with `(:include tensor)`. Code that accepts a `tensor` accepts both.

## Shape and reduction execution

Shape operations build validated views; reshape copies when its strides cannot represent the requested logical order. Concatenate and stack allocate independent storage.

Reductions group retained and reduced axes into rows, packing when inner rows are not contiguous. Compatible real float batches execute natively; integer and complex batches use upstream typed reducers. Destination-writing reductions compute before scattering, so overlapping views read their original values.

See [reductions](reductions.md) and [shape operations](shape.md) for their interfaces.

## Normalization

Softmax and RMSNorm group selected axes into contiguous inner rows using the reduction layout helpers. Typed single- and double-float loops compute into independent storage; optional widened accumulation affects sums. RMSNorm applies broadcast weights to that storage before any destination write. Results restore the input axis order, and out-forms copy into validated strided destinations.

See [normalization](normalization.md) for formulas, axes and precision, and [measurements](normalization-performance.md) for execution comparisons.

## Matrix multiplication

Matmul broadcasts batch axes and promotes vectors into matrix axes. Matrix products wrap existing storage with independent signed row/column strides and combine compatible batch axes into constant-stride GEMM runs. Vector products use dot/GEMV and retain packing for irregular matrix layouts. Overlapping inputs are snapshotted before batch writes. Destinations proven unique by upstream receive direct writes; other valid matrix layouts scatter from reusable scratch.

See [matrix multiplication](matmul.md) for shapes, dtypes and output behavior.

## Operation execution

Elementwise operations compute the broadcast shape and validate tensor dtypes, then pass storage, offsets and broadcast strides to one trivial-simd N-D operation. Upstream validates output uniqueness and snapshots aliased inputs before execution. Compatible contiguous axes coalesce into bulk runs; native-supported operations traverse arbitrary layouts in C. Other cases traverse storage directly in Lisp. Inputs support arbitrary strides. Out-forms reject layouts in which two logical elements share a storage location.

Lisp storage uses array access. Foreign storage uses typed CFFI access and remains owned by the caller; its memory must stay valid for the entire operation.

See [limitations](limitations.md) for what is not built yet.

[^struct]: Accessors are `tensor-storage`, `tensor-dtype`, `tensor-shape`, `tensor-strides` and `tensor-offset`. The shape and stride vectors are not copied on access; do not modify them.
