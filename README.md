> **Work in progress.** This project is under development; expect missing features and breaking changes.

NumPy-like N-dimensional tensors for Common Lisp, built on
[trivial-simd](https://git.sr.ht/~takeiteasy/trivial-simd) and `trivial-simd/blas`.

```lisp
(ql:quickload :cl-tensor)
(cl-tensor:make-tensor '(2 3))
;; => #<TENSOR :F32 (2 3)>
```

Construct, index and copy strided tensors; reshape and slice views; broadcast arithmetic, comparisons and selection; multiply matrices and batches; reduce and normalize axes; convert dtypes explicitly. See [limitations](docs/limitations.md) for planned operations.
